\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstract}
In this seminar paper we provide an overview and introduction to directed generative models,
which are able to produce data following a distribution (...?).
% more info what generative models try to achieve
After we have introduced several architectures, we will explore sigmoid belief networks (SBN)
as an early generative model.\\

Then we will turn to more recent proposals, in particular variational autoencoders (VAE) and
generative adversarial networks (GAN).
Variants of GANs have been shown to produce images which are able to fool a human discriminator 40\% of the time (citation needed, LAPGAN? or DCGAN?).
Additionally to exploring these models and theoretical foundation, we provide an intuitive and simple application of a GAN.

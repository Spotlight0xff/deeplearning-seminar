\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:motivation}
Generative models have been proposed as one of the most promising approaches towards
learning representations of real world data by some of the leading researches (YannLeCun, OpenAI blogpost).

In recent years supervised learning has yielded impressive results,
however for these models to suceed huge amount of labelled data is needed.
Unsupervised learning, that is learning from unlabelled data, has been expressed
as one hurdles toward general articial intelligence (citation needed).
Early approaches toward this problem however have shown that these problems are very hard to learn (intractable?).

In generative models the approach is different in a way that
we search for a good internal representation of the data.
This resembles the way humans learn about the world where we incrementally build
a model of the world.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Generative models have shown great promise to tackle interesting problems.
Academic work is moving incredibly fast and many new ideas and combinations
are being proposed almost daily (citation needed, meta paper?).
For example, VAEs and GANs have been combined (https://github.com/skaae/vaeblog)
which produced way larger images than GANs alone.

% not relevant, but wanted to write about it :p
As mentioned in the motivation, further advances to generative architectures are
likely to solve current issues with depending on large labelled data.
Another large and increasing area of research is semi-supervised learning
(combining learning from labelled data as well as unlabelled data)
and also one-shot learning, which is where humans excel and machines fail currently.

Exciting times :)
